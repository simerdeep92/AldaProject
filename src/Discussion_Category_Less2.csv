1,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","I, too, found the Culture Builder to be one of the best articles in Unit 2. &nbsp;There were many outstanding one-liners in addition to the one you cited. &nbsp;For example:* &nbsp;Good schools have few ""non-discussables.""* &nbsp;Take moral outrage at ineffective practices.* &nbsp;The most important school mission: &nbsp;provide a culture hospitable to human learning and make it likely that students and teachers will become and remain lifelong learners.* &nbsp;School is a community where everyone learns and supports the learning of others.All of this is easier said than done, of course, but well worth saying nonetheless."
2,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","Roland Barth was successful once again in making me think personally about how to make my school a better place where students learn. &nbsp;In his article Culture Builder (Ed Leadership, 2002) he opens with the assertion that an instructional leader's greatest challenge is to transform a toxic culture into a healthy culture. &nbsp;He further states that: ""All school cultures are incredibly resistant to change."" &nbsp;Did you catch the ""all"" in that statement? &nbsp;100% &nbsp;No exceptions. &nbsp;It made me think if my school was truly (incredibly) resistant to change. &nbsp;It likely is. &nbsp;Many of my staff has been at the building for double-digit in years. &nbsp;I am a relatively new on staff after six years in the building. &nbsp;Another claim Roland made was: ""The culture of a school is quite apparent to the newcomer."" &nbsp;With this in mind, I am going to ask the last two teachers hired to provide some feedback to me regarding the culture of our building. &nbsp;I look forward to hearing what they have to say.In wanting to connect this article to the challenges I foresee having in becoming a digital school - integrating 1-on-1 technology tools into the teaching of every student - it made me wonder about our culture in making this switch. &nbsp;I definitely don't think (but will ask my two new teachers) we currently have a toxic culture, but how resistant to change (including a digital change) would we be? &nbsp;How resistant would my teachers be to making changes in pedagogy? &nbsp; I believe our students are ready to learn differently - but is my staff?"
3,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","I agree, Robert, that our students are ready to learn differently; our teachers not so much! &nbsp;I think part of the teacher fear is allowing students to be in control of the instruction in the classroom. &nbsp;Some of the new teachers are more eager to let students take full reign, but our veteran teachers are more reluctant to try something new and sometimes view technology/digital initiatives as one more thing to learn."
4,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","It's very interesting to read each post and point of view. The culture within the school does weigh in all aspect of the learning community. Many times we get so used to our comfort zone and thus you get to hear the resilient "" ... but we have always done it this way!"" ... but it does take a really inspiring and strong leader to start making changes. Seasoned teachers need to hear and see by themselves that by learning &amp; implementing these new technologies will help them cut back, let's say on grading ... or by using a Google doc, they can edit or have students engage in peer editing.It is a ""one more thing to learn"" but it's imperative to let all know that it will pay off in the long run. The 1st year will indeed be overwhelming but from the 2nd year on, changes will be less and easier to cope with. ... my 2 cents!"
5,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","I work at a small, alternative school in VT that serves an at-risk population of students. We have a 1-to-1 laptop program in place, but are frequently having major issues with distractions. We have a firewall in place, but are still having incidents with students finding ways to access inappropriate material and engaging in cyber-bullying. We use interactive programs to personalize education, but laptops themselves do not magically get students ""interested"" in learning. We have a great student to teacher ratio (1:5), but are constantly having to redirect students as most of them are not interested in using their laptops for anything more than music videos and gaming. We use interactive games, video presentations, and virtual experiments to make things more interesting and kinesthetic - but once students realize that they will still need to think, type, read, and create - they go back to shirking responsibility and using technology to combat learning rather than to enhance it.These case studies are cute, but this really seems to be more of the same ivory-tower talk that persuaded me to leave grad school and get involved directly in public education. Laptops are amazing, particularly for students with some computer saavy and a genuine desire to learn and succeed. Most of our students end up at our school because they have not shown this. How does this program help me reach them?&nbsp;"
6,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","Our District has already implemented 1:1 computing initiative since 2010.&nbsp;We have been selected as a Project Red Signature District and are receiving support from their management them. &nbsp;In our middle school, every teacher and student have Chromebooks.&nbsp;Our District has also increase mandatory professional development to train teachers on how to effectively use technology, software programs, websites, tools, etc.... to enhance student learning. &nbsp;It is too early to detect any major results, but there are minute changes in students' willingness to learn through technology."
7,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","Student learning opportunities have been&nbsp;provided more for&nbsp; middle and high schools students/staff.&nbsp; Since there is only one middle and high school in my district,&nbsp;only select students and classes have access to laptops/software programs.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would like to &nbsp;suggest senior projects to district administration, staff, tech support staff and teachers&nbsp;which can &nbsp;include software programs to be utilized with the elementary students.&nbsp;"
8,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","For two years we did a 1:1 program with netbooks computers as well as using Google Apps for Education. During the time of our 1:1 program students and staff were pleased with the increase in their communication. Students had access to resources outside of the school day as well as an ability to connect with their teachers for more assistance and guidance. This year we have changed our route a bit and have gone to a BYOD program that we supplement with Chromebooks in the classroom. Students and staff still have the expanded learning opportunities since we still use GAFE, Edmodo, Moodle and other web based resources.&nbsp;<div>To continue to improve as we move down this road, professional development in the implementation of using these tools in and outside of the classroom needs to continue. Administration needs to support the need for this training for staff members and it needs to not be stand alone training but in collaboration with subject areas so teachers can see the seamless use of technology in their classroom and with their students.&nbsp;</div>"
9,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","We have implemented a 1:1 program in grades 5, 6, 7, and 8 with student-owned iPads.&nbsp; I feel that we had a very strong start with a great deal of enthusiasm and momentum but that we have not truly ""cracked the code"" of student-initiated/driven learning that is possible with the many online resources that they now have access to.&nbsp; I plan to work more closely with the lead teachers to identify resources and instructional approaches that will allow for more student-generated learning/project-based learning.<br>"
10,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?",That's too good that you have taken initiative to implement 1:1 computing. Please share how you managed to provide Chromebooks to each student.<br>
11,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","We are working on implementing a 1:1 program, but are still in the beginning stages of the process.&nbsp; This year was the first year students were allowed to bring their electronic devices into the buildings without them being confiscated.&nbsp; I am an advocate for BYOD and think we could use them as instructional tools instead of viewing them as a hindrance. <br>"
12,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?",At our high school we are using this school year for teachers to learn how to post their lessons and materials on Moodle with the expectation that next school year that students can find the coursework they are missing there at home or when they are in one of our ed labs. &nbsp
13,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","Our students at the high school (we have one) can bring devices, if their teacher permits them in the classroom.&nbsp; Many of the teachers don't know how to work with BYOD.&nbsp; I would like to see our district expand with the use of BYOD so students, and teachers, can feel comfortable accessing technology.&nbsp; I would like teachers to feel comfortable in a student-centered environment, knowing how they can best assist their students.<br>"
14,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","We have implemented BYOD at our high school as well, with teacher permission. &nbsp;The primary impact has been that students have access to the digital tools that they use outside of school. &nbsp;A very telling statement came out early in our planning process when a teacher commented that a student had asked permission to add an assignment to the calendar on their phone. &nbsp;We also have a large ESL population so the translation tools have been very useful. &nbsp;A big concern of ours was equity so our policy states that if a teacher is planning a lesson that incorporates technology, they need to have school technology available. &nbsp;Another benefit of BYOD has been the expansion of our technology as well as ""just in time"" learning. &nbsp;We implemented Google Apps several years ago and that is becoming used more widely. &nbsp;We are also implementing MyBigCampus, a learning management system that comes with our Lightspeed Filter. &nbsp;With our Transforming Classrooms project, we are striving to move to a more student-centered environment."
15,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","When we talk about expending students' learning through technology,&nbsp;we&nbsp;are considering mostly those &nbsp;students who are already in a school situation. Whereas, in the third world scenario, there is a vast majority of children who cannot&nbsp; go to a school for many reasons. The amazing factor is the enormous use of technology, like cellphones, in these countries, . A family may not have enough to pay the rent but each member seems to own a cellphone. This situation can be manipulated to enhance education and learning to even those who do not attend a school."
16,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?",I fell BYOD is our future. &nbsp
17,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?",I agree with Chrystalle. Students should be allowed to bring their electronic devices to the school. It is our job to plan and effectively use technology to facilitate 24/7 anytime anywhere learning and provide opportunities to the students for wider interactions to enhance their learning and positive learning outcomes.<br>
18,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","We went 1:1 at an elementary school this year and teachers were very excited, but I think at this point in the year some are starting to feel overwhelmed. The instinct I am seeing from the overwhelmed teachers is to pull back the technology thinking that will solve the problem, but then the students don't like it. The teachers that understand when you let the students figure it out they will blow you away are the ones succeeding. I would like to see more teachers willing to let go of control in order for students to succeed in directing their learning. Without this, opportunities are missed."
19,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","In September, 2013 the 1:1 computing initiative was implemented in my district grades 4-8. &nbsp;All students and classroom teachers received Chromebooks. &nbsp;The district is ramping up professional development opportunities in house for all instructional staff members."
20,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","With some blended electives courses, we have been able to expand our offerings to middle school students AND give teachers an opportunity to teach a more specific passion (gardening, travel, etc.). &nbsp;This has worked well for us, as we have a 1:1 program in place. &nbsp;Students go to a study hall type of environment 4 days/week and meet face-to-face with the teacher 1 day a week."
21,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?",For all of the above teachers and admins who have or are implementing 1:1 and BYOD in their schools:&nbsp
22,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?",PD is very important to implement 1:1. It should be started before commencing 1:1 program. Appropriate IT resource should be provided to the schools. We may ask students to bring their tabs or note books to start the initiative. But what about teachers??? they may bring their own laptops or could be provided by the companies on easy installments if school give their guarantee as they have teachers' provident fund .
23,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","Hi Jana,<div><br></div><div>Research shows that younger learners do not benefit from using technology due to them not distinguishing between what is real and not real. However, in just watching my grandchildren use technologies such as cell phones, tablets and laptops to play educational games there is a benefit for all learners no matter the age. I have to say it is the same for students that I taught at the early childhood to elementary level too. They are allowing middle schoolers to take online classes now too or plan to allow it in Southeast, GA. Perhaps, young learners should just have additional guidance or only have access to teacher directed technologies. That is the way it should be but teachers have to have a command of the technologies too. Moreover, they need to know what is appropriate for what age group.</div><div><br></div><div>I am posting in this area instead of A-L because I want to open a school up in an area that falls under these letters.

24,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","I think that the use of the proper technology tools will allow students to pursue projects that are more personalized to their interests. Through the use of rubrcis, I hope to allow my students to create their own topics, within certain parameters that allow students to still meet assessment and standard requirements. There is more up front work on the part of the teacher, but the work produced by the students si so much better since they have scope to pursue individual interests.<br>"

Rubrics are key here. &nbsp;I remember reading an article from last unit that stated one student preferred to use the technology, where another preferred the pencil and paper. &nbsp;By using a rubric, both students could earn full credit based on the work they did even if they are completely different."
26,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?",Proper technology tools (which are age appropriate) can allow even the youngest student to experience their interests and open a potential wider interest in a chosen with guided direction.&nbsp
27,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","In our district I think it is key to change with the age of technology for students to learn. &nbsp;Our students come from a place with constant social and media interaction. &nbsp;They feel that school is boring because of the way that teachers present the information. &nbsp;Students need to learn in a comfortable, friendly, safe environment. &nbsp;They want to learn things they experience and are interested in. &nbsp;Students want to use technology in order to learn all of these things. &nbsp;"
28,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?",How would you like to expand or have you expanded student learning opportunities?
29,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","To begin we cannot

ignore the advances in digital technologies and the proven benefit that some

districts have achieved.&nbsp; Professor Phil

Levy of HEA recently stated, ﾓNo

institution can ignore current developments in learning and teaching

technologies and resources; with the developments in Open Educational Resources,

MOOCS, social media and mobile learning, among others, this is a really timely

moment for institutions and staff to embrace fully what they can offer.""

For public schools, there is such disparity in access, beliefs, and policy, we

must begin there to start the discussion about the opportunities all children

should have."
30,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","To tell the truth, I think that all of the changes in technology and the new programs that seem to come out almost daily, it is really tough to figure out this challenge. &nbsp;I think it is very hard for school districts to know what to purchase. &nbsp;With budgets low and the economy in the tank, we need to try and figure out the best ways to spend our technology budgets.That being said, we also cannot stick our heads in the sand and ignore the need to keep up with the trends. &nbsp;We need to be open to change and willing to allow our students to learn through technology, which means they can be learning at home as well as at school.I'm not sure if I have answered this question adequately or not, but those are the thoughts that are running through my head at this time."
31,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","A systematic approach to HOW we change the elements of student learning is best. &nbsp;I've been in education for nearly 20 years. &nbsp;Sometimes as a teacher I felt like only people who held power positions were making all of the decisions for me as a teacher in the classroom. &nbsp;Students never benefited from this approach, and neither did I! &nbsp;Thankfully, I am in a district (the same district, by the way) where the people who hold the power are ALL of us, and we have teams of stakeholders making decisions about how, when, where student learning takes place. &nbsp;District and building teams, teachers and support staff, parents and students; these groups are all represented in the learning outcomes decisions and goals. &nbsp;With the digital conversion in our district, and as my superintendent says, we are hiring a new kind of administrator and a new kind of teacher today that we would have hired even 5 years ago. &nbsp;We are looking for individuals who are already used to collaborating, communicating, using creativity and critical thinking skills. &nbsp;We want individuals who are focused on our goals and who are willing to take a systematic approach for how we can make improvements for student learning. &nbsp;As an aside, we are also hiring different IT staff. &nbsp;We want IT folks to do what they do best! &nbsp;We need them for digital transformation to be sustainable, but we also want to involve them in in the system. &nbsp;A suggestion was made by our 1:1 implementer to take the IT staff on a walk-through in the buildings once a month (at least) so that they can see the fruits of their labor and know what a real difference they are making in our student learning goals. &nbsp;It speaks volumes to their value in the process!"
32,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","I'm not sure if we change how, when, and where students learn. Instead, we should look at how we encourage to use their surroundings and resources to learn. The students we teach have access. &nbsp;We should encourage the use of that access. &nbsp;A lot of these students that are coming in to the classroom have better connectivity that some school networks. &nbsp;I want to see schools and teachers embracing and allowing the students to use their technology to answer questions that arise in class. &nbsp;There should never be a moment where we ask students to find out at home and then share the next day. &nbsp;We live in an age of now and we should take advantage of that in our classrooms. &nbsp;"
33,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","The first thing that many schools or school systems need to change is the culture. &nbsp;I have visited the Mooresville Graded District, and the culture of student support and teacher collaboration is palpable. &nbsp;Second, schools need to have teachers on board--way on board--before they roll out technology; so that teachers are intimidated neither by the technology nor by students who know more than they about the technology. &nbsp;Third, the school needs very robust wireless and wired networks with large bandwidth to the Internet.Finally, testing (at the state and district levels) must reflect the kind of learning we want to provide. &nbsp;Without testing changes, we are putting new wine into old wineskins; and everyone will be frustrated. &nbsp;Keen Gravely"
34,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","

One challenge is changing the culture to one of collaboration, when many teachers are used to closing their doors and working independently. This has to be top down (Supt/administrators level) as well as throughout the entire school system but not just for technology- all decisions. We do an injustice to digital learning if we continually separate it out from curriculum, common core etc. rather than blending it in as a tool.Janna Elfrink said:

36,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","Hi everyone. Sorry to jump in mid-week.I think this is an important question, but I'd like to add to it.&nbsp;WHY&nbsp;do we need to change how, when, and where students learn? I think it is vital to understand that yes, there is a need to change, but why is there a need for such a change. There is a lot of talk about ""personalized learning"". In my mind, learning IS personal and should always be personal. So the question is, what are we doing now (and why are we doing it) that is making it not personal? I think that is where we begin to really understand the&nbsp;WHY&nbsp;of this much needed change. And that's where our discussions move beyond the immediate implications of educational technology and into the longer lasting benefits.What do you think?"
37,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","The educated person used to be the one who held the most knowledge in their head. &nbsp;As such, memorization defined intelligence. &nbsp;Yet, we now live in a world where anyone has access to all of the facts (not to mention all of the lies) on their phone. &nbsp;So education has transitioned from memorization to comprehension. &nbsp;Thankfully (in my opinion) the Common Core supports this change, focusing on critical thinking skills. &nbsp;Teachers need to follow this trend and think of themselves less as the purveyors of knowledge and more as facilitators of learning. &nbsp;-Spencer"
38,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","It is clear that public education must change and change quickly, because students are already graduating into a digital world, where long-distance collaboration has been the standard for years. &nbsp;Apple's development of its glass iPhone screen is an example (Apple put out a worldwide bid for engineers to help find the way to cut the glass). &nbsp;My wife consults from home with clients in Raleigh, the UK and China. &nbsp;Especially for smaller cities looking for new industry, digitally trained and capable high-school graduates will be essential. &nbsp;Even the partial return of manufacturing to small businesses require a shift to computer capabilities."
39,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","The question of what to buy is made easier by companies like Apple and examples like Mooresville Graded School District. &nbsp;Districts can combine their own vision with proposals from companies like Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung (chromebooks) and Apple. &nbsp;I think each company's pitch needs to be verified by school districts. &nbsp;The state of Maine has many years of experience, and it just moved from Apple to HP for equipment (http://www.kjonline.com/news/Maine-picks-school-laptop-contract-winner-.html?pagenum=full). &nbsp;Note the fascinating detail: ""Apple's 32-gigabyte iPad tablet, at $217 per device, was ranked both the cheapest and the highest-quality option recommended by the committee, whose members are from Maine, Hawaii and Vermont. The iPad scored the highest with 93 out of 100 points, while the HP ProBook earned 79 points, ranking fourth out of five.""That is an interesting choice. &nbsp;One article said the choice was influenced by the idea that students would be graduating into a business world dominated by Microsoft software. &nbsp;This observer notes that by the time 9th graders graduate the new Windows operating system will look entirely different, as will Office. &nbsp;Students adapt to new operating systems in, say, a long day, sometimes a short day. &nbsp;More important, in my view, is portability, battery life, and quality of equipment. &nbsp;The iPad is probably more like future computers than traditional laptops, as the new Microsoft surface portends."
40,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","One thing that I think is changing and will change more for students is that they, increasingly, will own their own learning; they will have to in order to compete in the global market. &nbsp;We can encourage them in that direction. &nbsp; It is a cultural change for many students , who have been schooled in listening and regurgitating. &nbsp;Some teachers are the same way: they attend staff development, figure out what responses are expected and give them, maybe not getting to the place where they own their own learning needs. &nbsp;"
41,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","At some point we have to remind ourselves how much is not really fundamentally changing- &nbsp;yes, the tools are different, the focus is changing from teacher-led to student-led, etc.. &nbsp;However; many of the digital learning models are either based on or an extension of learning theories that have been around for a long time. &nbsp;Revised Bloom's Taxonomy and learning domains, as well as Gardner's Theories of Multiple Intelligences come to mind. ""I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand."" This, attribituted to Confucius, has been around a while too.&nbsp;No doubt, revised Bloom's has resources and activities not imagined in the mid-1950's. &nbsp;The most exciting part about the changes though, come from the ways in which learners can now realize the upper levels. That realization is now the rule rather than the exception. &nbsp;For example, it seems that analysis, evaluation and creation activities in Bloom's are more commonplace in learning activities today as a result of the powerful analysis, evaluation, and creation tools that are now readily available in digital teaching &amp; learning resources. &nbsp;I don't mean to diminish the dramatically changing landscape at all. &nbsp;Rather, I think it's important to realize how many of these ""new"" resources are fundamental extensions of what has been right all along, just not as accessible to learners. &nbsp;"

I agree that we should not waste time in discussing personalizing learning. Students have always customized/personalized their own learning, regardless if they even knew that they did. That's why memorizing facts in the form of songs, or dances, or as a list or as an association to an object or place are all options for students. Fortunately, some teachers have taught students how to make those connections but many students already have those skills when they come to school.&nbsp;"
43,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","Leadership, Leadership, Leadership...I think is the most important component in changing how, when, and where students learn in K-12 schools.&nbsp; This leadership (at all levels) must begin with a shared vision for student learning, and how technology can be&nbsp;utilized to move towards students begin able to learn anywhere, anytime.&nbsp; This shared vision must be embedded into all aspects of the district and individual schools strategic plans, and be the guiding decision maker&nbsp;when it comes to budgets, teacher professional development, and&nbsp;selection of student resources.&nbsp; Not only must this vision be shared among the district/school leadership, but it must be shared among the teachers, parents, and community stakeholders for it to be effective and successful.&nbsp;-Jerri"
44,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","



We hear a lot about students needing to be able to learn ﾖ

unlearn ﾖ and relearn due to the constant changes.&nbsp; The way students are learning today will be

out-of-date by the time they leave high school.&nbsp;

We need to focus on skills where students can use collaboration and

communication to create instead of just ﾓuseﾔ a resource.&nbsp; In our district, we are moving toward the

flipped classroom model to allow more time for students to focus on these areas

in the classroom setting.&nbsp; It is a

process.



"
45,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","Personalized learning by its very nature demands that students be responsible for their learning, and thus held more accountable than every before. &nbsp;We need teachers who can support students in that transition and make certain that how we facilitate them helps them to accomplish the most gains."
46,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","We are currently in a position at our district that addresses this very question. &nbsp;A few years ago we began the first phases of 1:1 implementation at our high school with a team of 1:1 lead administrators and lead teachers. &nbsp;We researched successful implementation of 1:1, conducted site visits, focused on our vision and goals. Then we looked at the big picture to expand our 1:1 to the middle school and what that meant for students in grades K-6 that were not 1:1. We know that a digital conversion and digital literacy plan had to be implemented K-12 so we took the work to the building levels. &nbsp;Looking at our district board goals and our district technology plan, building teams developed a digital literacy vision. &nbsp;First came teacher knowledge: professional learning and training to determine the elements of student learning that are discussed in this lesson: How, When, Where. &nbsp;In our lower elementary buildings, each are developing their own plans for what role technology plays. &nbsp;To date we've employed an instructional technology specialist K-6 to help make the vision and goals real in the classroom. &nbsp;She works with the building administrators to guide professional learning so that technology is embedded in student learning. &nbsp;We know it is not about the stuff, but rather the learning targets and how technology can improve that experience for students. &nbsp;So- as I stated in a different post for this topic, a systematic approach is necessary. &nbsp;"
47,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","I can easily understand the potential of digital learning at the middle and high school levels, but I'm unsure about how to respond when asked about the proper role of technology in the early elementary grades. &nbsp;People often talk about ""K-12"", but can we really make statements about digital learning that apply across all the grades? &nbsp;I'd love to here from the elementary education folks about this."

Michael,&nbsp; It just so happens that my daughter's 9th grade math teacher uses Facebook as her platform for implementing the flipped classroom model.&nbsp; She actually has a page set up devoted to the class, and students can access videos for flipped learning and also assignments.&nbsp; The idea is also that all students can benefit from questions from each other.&nbsp; It does feel like (from a parent perspective) that having it be a class page, rather than the teacher, that it might avoid some of the hurdles you mention.&nbsp; I'm sure it depends on the district - and that is definitely a bigger policy and perception question, but I wanted to share in case it was a helpful way to look at it."

The ability to have timely information about what a student knows or doesn't know and to be able to connect the student with specific content and activities that meet his needs, abilities, learning style, and interests can provide teachers and students with tremendous opportunities.&nbsp; I think this can be very exciting for teachers - as they get to focus on the needs of students and guide them in their learning."

Digital learning provides a greater opportunity for student- driven and meaningful learning. I am seeing this as challenging for both students and teachers but also motivating and exciting for them. I think teachers are viewing teaching more as facilitating and are embracing the idea of the learning process as a collaborative effort.

103,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","To me, the most important shift that digital learning brings to the table is that schooling really will become primarily about learning now, and not just transmission of information. People don't have the capacity any longer to be the primary holders of the world's knowledge, and the ""stuff"" we know is often out of date before we really know it. Teachers now have to become experts in process, not experts in content. Content will never go away, and a certain amount will always be necessary for understanding process, but the two really become parallel and interrelated with digital technology.For students, memory is less crucial too, since we now have digital tools that do the remembering for us. What we need to know is (a) how to access that information, and (b) how to filter, organize, and curate from the vast amount of information that is now available to even the youngest child at a moment's notice."

133,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?",Yes it is a risk and a risk does not always work perfectly the first time out..... put there is a process of trial and error through reflection and looking at student work.

That colleague who is a critical yet supportive friends can notice things that a teacher doesn't see. <br>

I agree with this statement to some degree. There is not enough time in the day to keep up with all of the changes that are occurring.There has been a huge change in paradigm in the past decade. I had completed my Master's degree in instructional technology in 2008. I embraced the degree because I truly wanted more avenues for engaging students with learning through the use of technology. Many of me peers did not move forward with embracing technology integration. Now today, using technology to reach out beyond the walls of the classroom for communication, critical thinking,creating and collaboration is like a foreign language to some of my peers. They have not keep up with the change and they are used to a self-directed form of teaching.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>My school district provides many opportunities outside of the hours of the school day to learn and share uses of web 2.0 tools but not always built into the school day. Just this past Saturday, teachers gathered for 7.5 hours to exchange and sharing their learning their colleagues. Even though there were only 5 of us that represented our school, I felt that this was a terrific launch pad to expanding learning for the teacher.</div>"
135,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","The schools where I see the most positive changes in the ""culture"" of teaching and learning are those that have invested in ""technology integrationists"" - who were teachers first and now can help other teachers, model for them, coach them, encourage them. Also, these schools have leaders who lead by example when it comes to using technology and who want their teachers to personalize their own learning.<br>"

I once worked in a building where the principal wanted everyone to try take a risk that semester, even if we failed. &nbsp;The energy and positive culture that was created was phenomenal. &nbsp;I and my fellow teachers tried out new ways of teaching and other innovative ideas because the pressure was off. &nbsp;Based on that experience, I believe taking risks not only should be supported, but encouraged by leadership. &nbsp;If teachers are encouraged to take risks, school culture will impacted positively for both teachers and students."

<br><div>As Gail Pletnick would say, take small risks before you take big ones. In my district, the IT office is supporting a range of pilot projects. Each school put together a proposal that outlined what instructional goal they would be trying to reach, what technology they needed, and how they would use it. They also outlined interim goals and how they would evaluate the effectiveness of their effort. These are small scale projects, like a group of 2nd grade teachers using iPads to improve reading for a group of students who are behind.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Dysart, they have a Test Drive process that allows for small investments with the support that is needed to make sure it is effective.&nbsp;</div>"

146,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?",Community Partnerships is a necessary part of learning today.

In my opinion the teacher ideally would be able to be much more than a facilitator, with adequate technology the teacher could pre-record lessons, and curate links to videos or online resources, and increase their availability to do direct instruction with the students that are requiring more assistance. &nbsp;With adequate training and the proper tools, a teacher could essentially become their own assistant, with the added ability to really be able to instruct the students in the teacher's expertise. &nbsp;"

156,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","I love the idea about being content curators. I think at this point, students can get all the information they want to learn online but still struggle with finding good resources. By letting them choose which content to go more in depth about, allows for a student-centered approach and let them become owners of their own learning. I think teachers are afraid that they have to read everything before the students do and I think we need to shift away from that and let the students teach as well."

158,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","Whether or not changes in pedagogy are contingent on trends and innovations, is a moot point.

159,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","I believe that learning now has to be looked at as 24/7/365. &nbsp; I think our schools will have to offer a menu of services...more of a cafeteria approach then a plated dinner where everyone is served the exact same thing. &nbsp;I also believe this can be a saving grace for small districts because we can open up so many more opportunities for our students. &nbsp;Do you want to take government online so you have room to take band or do you want the traditional government class? &nbsp;We don't have anyone who can teach Chinese in our part of the world, &nbsp;but you can take that class online. &nbsp;I also see us expanding into a school of dual enrollments. &nbsp;Home schooled students may take some classes at a traditional school and others at home. &nbsp;some students may take some high school classes and also attend a local college for part of the day. &nbsp;Our school district may even provide the transportation in our rural area.We will be a school system in which every student has an individualized learning plan to prepare them for their future."
160,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","Hi everyone. Sorry to jump in mid-week.I think this is an important question, but I'd like to add to it. WHY do we need to change how, when, and where students learn? I think it is vital to understand that yes, there is a need to change, but why is there a need for such a change. There is a lot of talk about ""personalized learning"". In my mind, learning IS personal and should always be personal. So the question is, what are we doing now (and why are we doing it) that is making it not personal? I think that is where we begin to really understand the WHY of this much needed change. And that's where our discussions move beyond the immediate implications of educational technology and into the longer lasting benefits.What do you think?"

I often think the first partner we need to take in this transition to digital learning is the Human Resources Department!&nbsp; Participants here are all risk takers, not needing to be right every time they speak, but can we say the same for every teacher in our schools?

We need Human Resources to recruit, and Principals to recommend only candidates who have the knowledge that they no longer hold all the knowledge in their head.&nbsp; People who may be threatened by alternatives to the teacher being the single source of knowledge will shut out the outside world and try to block the free flow of information/learning in a classroom.

162,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","I agree with much that has been said.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; we must remember that learning is a process and requires some guidance and coaching.&nbsp; I think that we need to effectively teach young students how become effective online learners.&nbsp; If the change in pedagogy enables young students&nbsp;to develop as independent on-line learners, they will&nbsp;be more productive and independent as learners as they progress through school.&nbsp; &nbsp;"

164,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","I believe that making a long-range plan for technology integration is key for its success. &nbsp;Professional development for teachers is vital to that plan, as the teacher's role in the classroom will dramatically change when every student has a device in their hands to access information quickly, learning shifts from teacher-centered to student-centered, and collaboration between students is common practice in everyday learning. &nbsp;Teachers, like most people, resist change unless they can be made to see that digital learning holds vast advantages for students who will need digital skills to succeed in the 21st century."
165,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","I too agree that until a school commits to a device for each student, it is hard for teachers to imagine what this looks like."
166,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","I like your comments about a student-centered focus. Our kids have so much curiosity and so many good ideas.

167,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","Very well said Kay. &nbsp;Educator training and buy-in are essential to an effective implementation of digital learning. &nbsp;Professional development is so often over-looked due to time, financial, or other considerations. &nbsp;The seemingly obvious solution to this issue is to leverage technology to provide access for educators to professional development. &nbsp;However, it often seems that this option is not considered or implemented."
168,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","You bring up a very interesting point about the need for commitment in educating teachers. &nbsp;But, I think if the ""plan"" is too long then it loses some of the flexibility necessary. &nbsp;For instance 7 years ago many schools looked at wireless technology as a ""bonus"" but with mobile learning it has become a necessity. &nbsp;And that stuff isn't cheap. &nbsp;I think staggered long term plans with built in evaluation periods are a great compromise. &nbsp;"

I too believe long-range planning is critical; I would add that that planning should not be focused on a separate technology plan but rather on building a strategic plan that is focused on the ultimate goals and priorities of the district.&nbsp; If our goal in education is to prepare students for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century, the integration of technology and digital learning will be addressed.&nbsp; I, also, suggest that in building a strategic plan a collaborative approach be utilized that includes teachers, parents, students, community leaders and administration.&nbsp; If those voices are heard and reflected in the plan, there is ownership and it reduces the resistance to change since there is a deeper level of understanding."
170,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","This discussion begs the point of why the concept evolved from ""in service"" to&nbsp; professional development.Not only must teachers be taught the value and expertise of technology, the training should be&nbsp;&nbsp;goal oriented and needs specific.&nbsp; It might be necessary to guide some individuals to understand the type training they need to best promote learning in their area.&nbsp; There must be evaluation&nbsp; and feedback components to assure that the new techniques are used to the best advantage. For those who are ""behind"" it is incumbent upon the trainers to help teachers beyond any technophobia and embarrassment regarding skill level.&nbsp; As budgets financially shrink, time must be budgeted for professional collaboration and learning communities as ways to address training issues."
171,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","Yes, you all have some great thoughts and reflections on the place of technology in the classroom! &nbsp;To me, it is not only about having devices; it is about using them meaningfully so as to enhance student engagement and learning in the 21st Century. &nbsp;Training for teachers is essential, I agree. &nbsp;Students may already be privy to what teachers are not privy to in reference to technology, software, applications, etc. &nbsp;Giving students the chance to explore educational technology remains essential - especially if it revolves around providing meaningful media for students to synthesize and present information.&nbsp;"
172,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?",Great discussion and I couldn't agree more that is is how technology is used that is most important. It needs to be a very thoughtful design for technology integration that enables students to think critically and communicate that thoughts and ideas together and expand their own individual knowledge base. Writing in a collaborative environment with peer editors has also been important to our students. They care more about their writing and want to be seen as a good writer. It means much more than writing for a teacher and a grade.
173,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?",very well said. planning is extremely important in the education sector somehow due to the number of changes that are being made planning becomes very adhoc. the plan must also include ways of monitoring the implementation of the plan. In addition evidence needs to be collected to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan&nbsp
174,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","This is a very important discussion.&nbsp; With limited resources, we cannot afford to purchase technology that will not be effective in supporting student success.&nbsp; In Dysart we put in a test drive process that schools are required to use before we will approve a technology purchase.&nbsp; It is designed to require staff to research, plan and evaluate the results of the utilization of technology before that technology is purchased.&nbsp; It also allows the district to capture that planning to share with others who can then use the technology successfully in their classrooms.&nbsp; To see an outline of the process please visit&nbsp; https://www.dysart.org/Sites/Default.aspx?pgid=186."

Too often we start with the tech: ""Let's get devices into every students hands.""

I think one of the weaknesses in our current approach is that we adopt the technology and then try to figure out how to use it to make our existing learning goals more efficient.

186,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","Hi Dr. Kleiman,<div><br></div><div>I agree that expanding the curriculum and providing alternative learning approaches is very doable with digital learning. I personally like virtual classes over face-to-face classes even though the ones I have taken are much harder than face-to-face classes. Mainly, because in classes of high needs populations technology is not adequate, nor is there sufficient personnel, resources or other equipment. In online courses I have more options to choose a hybrid, part synchronous and asynchronous, I may go at my own pace (to a degree and that option has been stopped from providers I frequented for professional development online courses), attend when I have contagious diseases like chicken pox once my fever breaks, access the class at any-time, present the course in my learning preference and I may store what I need in the cloud. I may research online and select other references or teachers to help me understand if I do not understand my teacher, do not like his or her teaching style and I usually get to choose my group members on required team projects. So, a great way to use digital learning is to establish e-folios for student completion of goals and objectives on their own personal plan of study. If it is accessible and honored no matter where you go I think we would have more graduates and more honest assessments of students skills.</div><div><br></div><div>In static face-to-face classes I am stuck with who they assign as my teacher, suffer when they do not have the appropriate resources and face being in over crowded classes with little interaction due to the large class sizes. I do have a lot of technology compatibility problems since I use a Mac because my computer was sent to me with errors. Most online platforms are set up with Windows-based or android devices in education. I am most proficient with Windows and android devices since I am a 17-year educator. However, I still prefer online instruction as technology advances and we see the power it holds when used smartly, for my current needs and now more mobile than I'd like lifestyle. I am older though so that is why I prefer not waiting in traffic to get to the school building, I like being involved with wider audiences and I like having more options that are not available in one district or classroom.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>When I was younger, I liked face-to-face classes better. I like knowing everyone personally and letting them know me. I liked sharing the same passion for leading, teaching and learning and learning about learning from a student-center and universal technology sharing bent. Unfortunately, that has changed because classrooms where I have worked are battle zones and no one from the federal level down is doing anything about it even with timely reports. Technology is banned and when not fully banned it is inaccessible in school even with a BYOD/BYOT policy in effect in the district. I had more than 216 students in a 9-week period and that is just too many in my opinion on such an escalated basis when the whole computer science lab was down more than up and students did not have access to technology at home to bridge the sags, lags and gaps. Approximately 1000 students being exposed to technology gone wrong is not how you inspire students to love using digital devices in teaching and learning.</div><div><br></div><div>The district that I was in has a virtual school called DeKalb Online Academy (DOLA) that is used for student credit recovery and for AP students to take classes that are not offered. Seniors may take courses they need that is not offered at their school. They needed more teachers to help those with special needs and should employ CTI or Career Technical Instructors who are certified in both Business Technology Education and Exceptional Education to supply the adaptive-assistive technology needs for those learners. One model rotates where the teacher is in class for 6 weeks, in an office on site or at the district for 6 weeks and online for 6 weeks. Some instructors are strictly online educators. The school offering DOLA During the day is supposed to have a classroom set up for students to access. That was never really available when my students had to take DOLA coming from out of state to schools in Georgia. Students would be moved around from the Library when it was available to just sitting in the front office or the counselor's office for the period. If they had access at home they completed what they should have completed in school or went to the local library if they did not have resources at home.</div><div><br></div><div>Partners that used the school facilities during the evening used the SMS stations. They would come in and view the monitor, take notes and hit the buzzer devices. They got rid of those at one high school I taught at.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Hence, I agree that there is controversy regarding online classes not being as good as face-to-face classes. To try to validate online classes there seems to be a lot more work involved. In this same district that I am discussing a colleague was not promoted to an administrative or quasi-administrative position because the masters degree that the person had was earned from an online college as opposed to a brick and mortar university. With all the accreditation issues, cheating scandals, e-mail scandals and racketeering from&nbsp;former superintendency and chief operators that the district has suffered it should not matter where the person got the degree from as long as the professional standards commission backs that person's professional, highly qualified teaching certificate.</div>"

Hi Joyce,<div><br></div><div>I think that awarding the badges in an e-folio per accomplishment would be great for some learners like the gamers in my classes. They absolutely love that extrinsic motivator.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Some students are motivated differently or in addition to the badge. I was using a current free typing program for middle graders because the computers were too old to load 2003 software. One student got an award for outstanding typing with no errors, great speed and the whole deal. I did not even have a printer to print the badge and accompanying certificate. So, I announced the great work the student did to the class and pointed happily to the computer screen. The student pulled me aside and told me that she needed physical rewards not the badge because you have to go on a computer to see it and once the student was out of the class who would know? To honor her preference for recognition I asked what she physically wanted as a reward. I believe she said a bag of chips so she got that too once she e-mailed me everything because she had a point on no one knowing outside of class without us documenting it as a screen capture and pdf file that I printed at an office supply store retailer. The chips are more perishable than the electronic badge but students at that school liked to carry name brand food items around when they could such as right before lunch and at the end of school when they could purchase snacks before getting on the bus to go home. Also, I do not think it is too cool or kuel to accomplish things without suffering a few bullying remarks from others who make it their business not to succeed at anything school or career related.</div>"

Hi Gail,<div><br></div><div>You are so right that students use online classes to do more than ""making up credit"". In a high school that had industry certification distinction that I taught at our students used online courses to meet Gordon Rule requirements and earn dual enrollment credits. We articulated programs from the high school to the technical institute, community college or university that all worked together in steering the student to a dual diploma, applied science associate degrees and possibly an advanced degree in Career Technology Education. These students did this primarily because all of our computers in the MAC lab were stolen from my class that year. Some students participated so that they could earn college credit free, because they needed to work to support their family and go to high school/college and others did it to challenge self. Some did it to earn scholarships. Therefore, you are right students gained control over their learning when losing something like a whole grant-funded lab in your senior year would have made learning a major problem from a district situation that was out of their control.</div>"

Hi Collette,

Thank you for your insight. I will surely look into the options you presented and see how I can contribute to helping teachers become mentors.

I agree - we still need to provide those ""discovery"" types of lessons where we help the children find or discover the knowledge - We are now their sideline coaches - encouraging them along and providing guidance in lieu of standing in the front of the class dispensing information.

215,"Changes in what, how, when and where students learn?","Like some others have commented, I think the physical environment will look different. &nbsp;I think students will have many more opportunities to learn virtually and the traditional class structure that currently exists will not be as common, particularly at the high school level. &nbsp;Students will have the flexibility to learn anywhere at any time of day. &nbsp;I also think students will have the opportunity to pursue more of what interests them, as well as learn in a manner that fits their own personal style of learning. &nbsp;Learning will become more student-directed.<div><br></div><div>Teachers will also enjoy increasing flexibility and mobility. &nbsp; Both teaching and learning will benefit from increased choice. &nbsp;I think teachers will be encouraged to take risks and implement new concepts and methodogies in their classrooms, be they face to face or virtual. &nbsp;It will mean teachers will have to give up some control, but they will gain far more than they lose by doing so.</div>"

I like what you said about the storerooms! During one a recent webinar I think the issue of backpacks and lockers came up.

I am excited to think about a possibility of no longer restricting students to closed classrooms and grade-level groupings. &nbsp;I welcome a transition away from a mandatory ""180 days"" in a grade level before you can move on; just as much as for those students who may need more than 180 days not to have to repeat another 180 days when possibly only a fraction of that time would be needed. &nbsp;Hopefully the fluid nature of the Common Core Standards will free educators from the rigid timetable it has adhered to for generations.<br><blockquote class=""Quote"">

What a great idea for early release on Wednesday. &nbsp;I had the opportunity to visit German schools and this concept was in place in their educational system as well. &nbsp;In our district, we have two early release days--one each semester. &nbsp;At the high school level, these two days are geared towards senior projects as students present their projects to a panel of judges. &nbsp;In my opinion, this schedule is to alleviate teachers who are judges from having to stay after school. &nbsp;So, time is the key factor here. &nbsp;"

261,Major challenges to making recommended changes?,"Amen to what Benjamin posted on funding! Funding is a problem for the prior K-12 school system that I worked for because the leaders keep stealing millions of dollars of student and taxpayers' money. What they don't steal they misappropriate even when they find millions that was earmarked for stealing.&nbsp;When they purchase technology they leave it in warehouses because it is inappropriate for education or way too old for today's learners. Most procurements are done on a friends and family, nepotism hook-up. That just makes educational matters and student behavior worse with this economy and the feeling that no one cares about their education.Funding was held up for purchasing some schools laptops to issue to students.The plan was to cure health issues related to students carrying too many books and causing self or others injury. They were supposed to also have access to electronic texts. New computers were issued district-wide with replacements in effect every five years. Many complaints came against schools having technology that was 12-years old or older. Yes, the technology was older than most students in preschool to middle school! They also got complaints for students not being able to use their adaptive-assistive issued laptops in class because some regular education teachers were uncomfortable with using technology. All I can say to that is WOW! Really? In the 21st Century Digital Learning Age?Like the local community that Gail spoke of, we have digital divides. These divides even surface in our community of learners in schools. So, it is great to show and tell at the district or on channels that show district meetings on TV. In the former district I worked for, they had less than 1% parent participation and parents were really apathetic. Hence, showcasing did not help because parents or first-teachers cared less.Collette"

Mary Ann,I have actually done many presentations for schools, school boards, and state representatives myself. &nbsp;We have showcased digital learning in many different ways, but just providing the showcase doesn't mean people will show up. &nbsp;You can only educate when someone is ready to learn. &nbsp;It seems as though far too many people in the general population are so preoccupied with ""just making it"" and the concept that ""it was good enough for me when I was in school"" that they can't see what tomorrow will really look like. &nbsp;And that shortsightedness only hurts all of us in the long run.&nbsp;I think Gail has several great ideas and I am glad that those have worked in her community, but by no means does that mean that they will work for all. &nbsp;But, everyone can continue to provide opportunities and keep fighting the good fight.If you look at the documentation that was provided in this course both North Carolina and Maine have demonstrated success because the state leadership has recognized the importance for technology and allocated funding to make it happen. &nbsp;Far too many states have not taken that approach and grant creativity has limits. &nbsp;Other statewide initiatives that have not come from the top are from states that also receive high student funding. &nbsp;Operations like Huntsville, AL are few and far between and would not happen without help from voters and Fortune 500 companies. &nbsp;Funding is at the heart of advancement.&nbsp;"

I think we have to continue to show and then convince stakeholders of the urgency, while also planning carefully...I have long studied the statewide work in North Carolina and Maine, and I have also seen some interesting results in Virginia and Alabama because of partnerships between the governor and departments of education at the state level.&nbsp; When districts can jump on what statewide efforts make possible, you really can see accelerated change.&nbsp; Virginia built out broadband because of early efforts for online testing which paved the way for an online school, professional learning opportunities, and more.&nbsp; Alabama has a 21st century classroom in every high school, including the broadband needed for students to tap into online courses.&nbsp; These efforts were almost lost leaders for districts to take the possibilities further when the leadership and vision were in place.&nbsp; I can't wait to hear how others are tackling these challenges - great discussion."

I think there needs to be a complete paradigm shift in the way we look at education. &nbsp;MANY see the need in a complete revamping of education but too many people are seeing it as an opportunity to cash in on the change instead of leading for the benefit of the students. &nbsp;I don't feel this is an issue that needs more funding, but more of a shift in the way we teach, especially at the college/teacher preparation level. &nbsp;Too many colleges are still training teachers they way it was done 20, 30, 50 years ago. &nbsp;Focus on 21st century skills and teaching and the change can start to happen. &nbsp;18 year olds starting college know how to use technology, but they have no idea how to integrate technology successfully in the classroom. &nbsp;We need to move beyond, ""Now class, you have 20 minutes to make a PowerPoint on...."" &nbsp;Current classroom teachers need support to implement the change. &nbsp;This is where a Technology Integration Specialist in every school would be beneficial. &nbsp;Most teachers that I have come into contact with are willing to try but afraid to fail, especially if that failure happens in front of students. &nbsp;Give them the support they crave and change will start to happen.





To change what teachers coming out of college know in regards to the smooth implementation of technology in their teaching we have find ways to educate the professors who are often times teaching as the 'sage on the stage' and not bringing in the use of technology into teacher preparatory courses. Pre-service teachers need to see and experience this use of technology in college to bring it to their future classrooms.&nbsp;"
276,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"Great ideas! I teach in a teacher training program for ed-tech specialists and we grapple with these issues every day. How do we get our own supervisors to help us shift our curriculum to allow for great incorporation of collaborative tools, social networking and using these tools as a means, and not an end.When we send our students out on teaching practice, they spend most of their time working with faculty who are often desperate for any help they can get. They know they need to adapt because they are at the 'coal-face' and they see their students coming in with these tools, or at least know that the students use all these tools at home. Their own children are using them!"
277,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"Unfortunately, learning

about technology is equivalent to asking teachers to hit a moving&nbsp;target. Teachers will

never have ﾓcompleteﾔ knowledge about the tools available, as they are always

changing. This may result in teachers being perpetual novices in the process of

technology integration which suggests the need for teachers to&nbsp;have strong

self-efficacy for teaching with technology.&nbsp;



To use technology to

support student centered instruction, teachers need additional knowledge of the

content they are required to teach, the pedagogical methods that facilitate

student learning, and the specific ways in which technology can support studentsﾒ

learning. For example, as teachers

involve their students in more interdisciplinary work, their content knowledge

will need to grow. Pedagogical knowledge will also need to expand to include

ideas about how to develop studentsﾒ abilities to work collaboratively or to

take control of their own learning in a technology-rich environment. Finally,

teachers will need to understand the relationships between resources and the

skills,&nbsp;concepts, and processes of content. Based on their knowledge of

both&nbsp;their learners and the subject, teachers will need to be able to

select the most appropriate&nbsp;resources to enable their students to meet the

required learning goals.



Current classroom teachers MUST HAVE support to

implement this change. &nbsp;This is where my job as Instructional Technology

Resource Teacher needs to be in every school to be beneficial. &nbsp;Sadly, our

county removed the physical ITRT support from the elementary schools and only

supports middle and high schools. The teachers that I have come into contact

with are willing to try technology with students but afraid to fail, especially

if that failure happens in front of students. &nbsp;



My suggestions for changes are TOP downﾅour supervisors,

principals,&nbsp;and&nbsp;teachers. It MUST

be a consistent movement with ALL on

the same page. If one is not able to complete technology skills then they need

to be in the remediation group until they have become successful BUT if success is not obtained then SERIOUS repercussions should be made to

those teachers/supervisors/principals; because ultimately the students are

suffering from the teachers/supervisors/principals lack of knowledge of appropriate

uses of technology in the classrooms."

However, I would challenge all of us that we don't need these specialists, we need it to simply be a skill that ALL teachers possess coming out of our teacher prep programs. &nbsp;No longer are teachers the gatekeepers of all information, they must become an specialist in the integration all the content found on the internet and at the fingertips of the kids."

They are confident technology users for sure, but not really aware of what the tools might be tale to do for them. For example, few students students understand how to take notes and tag those notes so as to make connections later. In fact, I have never seen a student do that. Nor have I ever seen teachers grade students on how well they can describe or categorize information in a given subject. 



We need to understand how students understand what they get from our teaching and from their own experiences with our content. I think that is the real meaning of listening to students. As we follow their ways of knowing, we can structure learning activities for them that best meet their goals and their needs. If we all did that as teachers, we'd be doing pretty well, I think."

303,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"I agree with Jamie. Additionally, teachers have to give up a little control and allow for changes in the traditional classroom. Children have different needs and technology can accommodate those needs."
304,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"I agree with both of Jamie's points and I want particularly to affirm the comment that public perception of what education means, including students' adult support at home, needs to be gently expanded. We need to be having more parent-teacher communication, parent-admin communication. Ideally, parents and guardians will be involved with their children's education using similar modes and tools their students use to learn."
305,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"But could it be that kids need structure? ""Suffocating"" seems pretty strong. It worked for us. Change is good and necessary, but giving too much flexibility is just adding to another problem--too much choice. In the west we are addicted to choice! If I don't like it I'll buy another brand, take my business elsewhere! Will more choice just make us more spoiled? And if you don't think we're spoiled, wake up. Grade 5 students with iPhones--because they ""need them"". Structure is important. A classroom can't function without it. Going on the premise that every student will be engaged if the tech is right is crap. Some will work, many will waste their time. Provide a lot of structure & integrate tech in the early years and move toward a more flexible model as they grow and get into high school."
306,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"I wonder if for the sake of structure we don't want just keep the control. We tend to replicate the same order we were subjected to. The assumption should be that any child likes to search and is curious to learn,so the school should provide an open setting so that learning takes place. As Ken Robinson says it seems that the curve of imagination and creativity goes down as a child progresses to higher school levels. The drawers of knowledge, the segmentation, the bell ringing every 45 minutes. As John Taylor Gatto says �the institution (school) is psychopathic - it has no conscience. It rings a bell and the young man in the middle of writing a poem must close his notebook and move to a different cell where he must memorize that humans and monkeys derive from the common ancestor�. When we look at school buildings with fences around, don't they look like jails? It's for the protection of children... but shouldn't a school be an open space to the community? Many years ago, I had a good experience with a a public library run by a rural municipality, that transformed it into a social centre, with multimedia areas and kind of living rooms, opened till 11 p.m. The library was in fact the cultural centre of that small town, very lively and crowded. Desired by the population, it was an attractive place, with conferences, exhibitions, etc.The school should also be a desirable place to go and there are schools that engage students in that way - free schools, democratic schools (where kids prefer to stay in school rather than go on holidays) - they provide a supportive environment and respect for the individual. Much of the insubordination and violence that happens in many schools is a consequence of very authoritarian and repressive environments. How can someone enjoy such a place and how can one learn. Freinet stated what he called �Les invariants p�dagogiques�, a kind of pedagogical code, independent of time and place, principles to respect the child:

Invariant n�1 L'enfant est de la m�me nature que l'adulte. 

Invariant n� 2 Etre plus grand ne signifie pas forc�ment �tre au-dessus des autres. 

Invariant n� 3 Le comportement scolaire d'un enfant est fonction de son �tat physiologique, organique et constitutionnel. 

Invariant n� 4 Nul - l'enfant pas plus que l'adulte - n'aime �tre command� d'autorit�. 

Invariant n� 5 Nul n'aime s'aligner, parce que s'aligner, c'est ob�ir passivement � un ordre ext�rieur. 

Invariant n� 6 Nul n'aime se voir contraint � faire un 

certain travail, m�me si ce travail ne lui d�pla�t pas particuli�rement.

C'est la contrainte qui est paralysante. 

Invariant n� 7 Chacun aime choisir son travail, m�me si ce choix n'est pas avantageux. 

Invariant n� 8 Nul n'aime tourner � vide, agir en 

robot, c'est-�-dire faire des actes, se plier � des pens�es qui sont 

inscrites dans des m�caniques auxquelles il ne participe pas. 

Invariant nﾰ 9 Il nous faut motiver le travail. 

Invariant nﾰ 10 Plus de scolastique.

Invariant10 bis Tout individu veut r�ussir. L'�chec est inhibiteur, destructeur de l'allant et de l'enthousiasme. Invariant10 ter Ce n'est pas le jeu qui est naturel � l'enfant, mais le travail. 

Invariant nﾰ 11 La voie normale de l'acquisition n'est 

nullement l'observation, l'explication et la d�monstration, processus 

essentiel de l'Ecole, mais le T�tonnement exp�rimental, d�marche 

naturelle et universelle. 

Invariant n� 12 La m�moire, dont l'Ecole fait tant de cas, n'est valable et pr�cieuse que lorsqu'elle est vraiment au service de la vie. 

Invariant nﾰ 13 Les acquisitions ne se font pas comme 

l'on croit parfois, par l'�tude des r�gles et des lois, mais par 

l'exp�rience. Etudier d'abord ces r�gles et ces lois, en fran�ais, en 

art, en math�matiques, en sciences, c'est placer la charrue devant les 

boeufs. 

Invariant nﾰ 14 L'intelligence n'est pas, comme l'enseigne la 

scolastique, une facult� sp�cifique fonctionnant comme en circuit ferm�,

ind�pendamment des autres �l�ments vitaux de l'individu.&nbsp; 

Invariant nﾰ 15 L'Ecole ne cultive qu'une forme abstraite 

d'intelligence, qui agit, hors de la r�alit� vivante, par le truchement 

de mots et d'id�es fix�es par la m�moire. 

Invariant n� 16 L'enfant n'aime pas �couter une le�on ex cathedra. 

Invariant n� 17 L'enfant ne se fatigue pas � faire un travail qui est dans la ligne de sa vie, qui lui est pour ainsi dire fonctionnel. 

Invariant nﾰ 18 Personne, ni enfant ni adulte, n'aime 

le contr�le et la sanction qui sont toujours consid�r�s comme une 

atteinte � sa dignit�, surtout lorsqu'ils s'exercent en public. 

Invariant nﾰ 19 Les notes et les classements sont toujours une erreur.&nbsp; 

Invariant nﾰ 20 Parlez le moins possible. 

Invariant nﾰ 21 L'enfant n'aime pas le travail de 

troupeau auquel l'individu doit se plier comme un robot. Il aime le 

travail individuel ou le travail d'�quipe au sein d'une communaut� 

coop�rative. 

Invariant n� 22 L'ordre et la discipline sont n�cessaires en classe. 

Invariant nﾰ 23 Les punitions sont toujours une erreur.

Elles sont humiliantes pour tous et n'aboutissent jamais au but 

recherch�. Elles sont tout au plus un pis-aller. 

Invariant nﾰ 24 La vie nouvelle de l'Ecole suppose la 

coop�ration scolaire, c'est-�-dire la gestion par les usagers, 

l'�ducateur compris, de la vie et du travail scolaire. 

Invariant n� 25 La surcharge des classes est toujours une erreur p�dagogique. 

Invariant nﾰ 26 La conception actuelle des grands 

ensembles scolaires aboutit � l'anonymat des ma�tres et des �l�ves; elle

est, de ce fait, toujours une erreur et une entrave. 

Invariant n� 27 On pr�pare la d�mocratie de demain par 

la d�mocratie � l'Ecole. Un r�gime autoritaire � l'Ecole ne saurait �tre

formateur de citoyens d�mocrates. 

Invariant n� 28 On ne peut �duquer que dans la dignit�.

Respecter les enfants, ceux-ci devant respecter leurs ma�tres est une 

des premi�res conditions de la r�novation de l'Ecole.&nbsp; 

Invariant n� 29 L'opposition de la r�action 

p�dagogique, �l�ment de la r�action sociale et politique est aussi un 

invariant avec lequel nous aurons, h�las! � compter sans que nous 

puissions nous-m�mes l'�viter ou le corriger. 

Invariant n� 30 Il y a un invariant aussi qui justifie tous nos t�tonnements et authentifie notre action: c'est l'optimiste espoir en la vie. (in ICEM site )"
307,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"It does seem to me that allowing students to set their own pace to increase engagement.&nbsp; Psychological studies have shown that too much choice may be stressful, but I think it is worth it for the gains of individualized learning.&nbsp; And it will be their ability to self-initiate, persevere, and inquire that will serve them better than any curriculum."
308,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,Structure and freedom to express and have some self determination in learning are not mutually exclusive.&nbsp
309,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"Margaret, I really like your points. School isn't jail, however, it is run like a factory where the structure is confining physically with closed classrooms, grade separation, and a robotic bell system. I think that providing guidance to students will help them make the choices they need rather than being locked into a system where they are told what to do and how to think."
310,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"I think choice is important to a certain point. I still believe that students desire some structure to their learning. This does not necessarily mean that a bell has to ring every 47 minutes, but based on a student's age and maturity an adequate amount of structure is required. Finding the balance between structure and control is very difficult.&nbsp;"
311,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"Not everybody learns best using paper and pencil. Some students CAN'T learn if their only choice is to use paper and pencil (students with severe dyslexia who can't read the words on a page, students with physical disabilities who can't hold a paper or pencil, or students with visual impairments who can't see the paper). As we normalize the use of technology in educational environments for ALL students, the ones who must use it, will be less marginalized. Plus, giving students options in how to interact with their content materials, through the use of technology, can help to engage students and allow them to use tools that fit their learning styles."
312,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"You are right in that many students have problems with paper and pencil, but we will also have students who have trouble with computers. We need to make sure we are trying to reach students where they are with ""technology"" that will help them."
313,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"This will certainly be an interesting subject as digital learning in education progresses, as teachers will need to have equal lessons available for those who are unable to use computers for religious, financial or other reasons. &nbsp;Making sure the lessons are equally available is usually mandated."
314,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"Basically planning! I feel vision is important because I've seen it too many times a school/district goes to implement something and 3 years later they chuck it for something else. This leaves teachers uneasy and less incentive to buy in because they feel it's going to be gone soon anyway. In addition, when something is introduced, it needs to be properly piloted before being released at a wider level. I've seen two district I've worked for try to implement a new program to use, only to have it fail because it didn't have teacher buy in because it wasn't properly vetted before it went out to the entire teaching population. Lack of communication in the vision hurts also. Right now in my district we have too LMS's being supported because different departments at the district level aren't talking to each other. I think if we had a clearly defined vision, things we be better for all the stakeholders involved. This vision should include what tools and resources are going to be used, a timeline for properly vetting the tools with a group of beta testers, roll out to the district, then a proper time to truly judge programs are developing how you expected them to.&nbsp;"
315,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"Great points, Jason. You will notice in this MOOC-Ed that we focus on creating a vision and planning, as well as the idea that technology and digital learning is not on the side or a stand-alone effort.&nbsp; Digital learning must be viewed as being part of all aspects of the education system.&nbsp; I'll be curious to see your thoughts on the Digital Readiness Self Assessment, as well as the other key areas in the course."
316,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"In my own experience, I find that classroom teachers often have more technology experience and risk-taking behavior than administrators. Administrators frequently don't want to support upstart digital learning projects if they had a grassroots origin from a classroom teacher who was awarded a technology integration grant. District tech people may also push back on non-sanctioned tech acquisitions that support classroom digital learning projects. If the process isn't decided on and implemented in top-down fashion it's like swimming against a strong current in many districts."
317,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"Jason, I agree. I have found that if you start with what you want accomplished first(student outcomes, staff productivity, etc.), and then find the technology that best helps you get there, you are so much better off. Too often we buy hardware and software without thinking it through."
318,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"I don't know if I am posting in the right place, but I have just watched ex-Governor King's video about the 1-2-1 laptop rollout in Maine. &nbsp; It was refreshing to see a politician so committed to this idea, and he's a big believer. &nbsp;But I was curious about the level of planning that went on as they seem to have suffered from budget cutbacks. &nbsp; I'm not sure the video explained how far they got, so it begs the question on any scale, is it better to plan for the long term and scale back the piloting to ensure there is enough budget to 'see it through' = in other words see the kids through 12th grade? &nbsp; &nbsp;Did they budget enough time and money for teacher training? &nbsp; &nbsp; It's a heavy financial commitment that needs thinking through. &nbsp;But his reflection on the success of the project were refreshing and he continues to believe in the value of technology in schools."
319,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"Mary, There are many places where you can post, so this works.&nbsp; You may want to hit ""Forum"" at the top of the course screen and jump into the current unit 2 (until tomorrow) and then 3...&nbsp; You have hit on many important points about the work in Maine, including the importance of support from the governor, others at the state, and the districts and schools.&nbsp; Most of the high schools in Maine have now expanded the program, but this did take some time. We have all been able to learn from Maine, as they really jumped in ahead of most other districts and states.&nbsp;"
320,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"I agree that colleges can provide support, training and modeling. Colleges began with blended learning models many years ago. There are people who would never have been able to attend or graduate from college had they followed a traditional model. By incorporating blended learning into schools, students will be prepared for college's ever changing models."
321,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"Yes, we need good models and instructions on what works best I real classrooms and not those with hand-picked keeners to show how wonderful the latest idea is. The greatest problem is we won't know the long term effects of these changes for a long time. Fads we don't need. Positive change we do need, and we need to be shown how to do it."
322,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"David, I could not agree with you more! It is such a struggle for educators today to know what is best and what will work for our students in the future. How will such changes affect their brain structures and then their children's brains? What capabilities will they lose? Will the gains outweigh the losses? On the other hand, we know that the ""factory model"" does not work. I'm not sure there is one answer and that is part of the problem. There are educational systems working so well in Finland, Singapore, and the Netherlands, and there are schools in CA and NY that seem to have a grasp on innovative ways of teaching, and there are a handful of colleges/universities that get it - but each is different. I went to Hampshire College in Amherst, MA in the early 1990s and it was considered radical - no grades and all independent learning and design your own program. It was a risk but it paid off even though it was against the norm (though I think it increased my brain function rather than alter it!). Anyway, we must more ahead and then wait for the neurologists and the next generation to provide us with hard data!"
323,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"Yes! In order to avoid reinventing the wheel by trial and error, we need specifics about what the ""room"" looks like--what are the students doing? What are the ""authentic projects"" they're working on? What is the teacher doing? How is s/he monitoring progress? How do you make it work for inner city or rural kids who are working far below grade level, but have been promoted through the grades along with their age cohorts? What are the information curating skills they need to learn to effectively use their massive access to information?

I'm a concrete learner, so I need to experience it in action in order to comprehend at a core level."
324,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"Heather, great questions - I hope this course can give us some answers to our burning questions!"
325,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,I think we have to look at the school as a community of learners.&nbsp
326,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"<p>John, this is a great way to look at learning.&nbsp; </p>"
327,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"I agree that our school model need a&nbsp;major overhaul. Instead of students working separately on math, science, English, and social studies, they should be incorporating all subjects in math/science projects with reading and writing relative to the projects. I'd also like to see students be able to move on when ready and not by seat time in a classroom or age."
328,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,What suggestions do you have for students without internet access due to lack of funds?&nbsp
329,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"Simple can be better. Do less and do it better. If they don't have net access at home, don't give homework that requires it. There's a good chance most homework goes undone anyway. I'm sure this is nothing you haven't already thought of but maybe you just need some one to reaffirm. You and we, can only do our best. Asking this shows you care."
330,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,Some of our students who do not have internet access utilize the computers at the local libraries. We also make computer time available for after school for those students.&nbsp
331,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,Thoughtful change needs to be expressed to the parents as a way to increase learning and discovery. &nbsp
332,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"I have taught in several districts in metro Atlanta now and the integration of technology has been an important part of the last 10 years of my career. With the world becoming more and more global and the students digital natives, we need to adapt our ways of teaching to what they need in order to succeed in the future. The days of people having one job or one career are over. It is predicted that our students will have 4 to 7 careers in their lifetime. The need to learn skills that will make them marketable to their future employers.&nbsp;I believe we need to re-evaluate the skill sets and curriculum to what will be useful to our students. We have started with cross-curricular lessons and have made learning a more hands-on experience. I think that is a step in the right direction, however, we have a long way to go. We probably should start by analyzing what the employers of the future will require from our students and go from there.&nbsp;"
333,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"One of the things we have been sharing with out teachers is the fact that most of the the jobs our students will have (we are a K-8 district) do not exist yet, so how do we train them to be successful. We do that by training them to effectively collaborate, communicate, think critically, and be creative."
334,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"I won't presume to know exactly all of the changes that need to occur, however, I feel that thoughtful and inclusive changes need to occur in order to meet the individual needs of our students.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The thoughtful part will occur through conducting needs assessments, setting goals based on the results of those assessments, and finally implementing plans in order to meet those goals. There will also need to have the different needs of schools taken into consideration, for example, how to develop a blended learning model in a high poverty school where most of the students do not have internet access at home. Yes, extending school hours and encouraging use of the public library are both options, but transportation issues also will arise.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>By inclusive I mean that technology decisions need to stop being made using the top-down model. A well-rounded group of stakeholders should be involved: students, parents, teachers, administrators, and technology experts from the district need to have a voice in the planning for use of educational technology. These decisions should include plans for professional development for teachers so that technology can be used effectively with students.</div>"
335,Most important changes needed in K-12 education?,"I think that educators at all levels are aware of the need for change, but most do not know how to begin or where. Notwithstanding, there are some schools out there, primarily in Europe (though some in the United States) that have begun the transformation journey. We need to get these schools to publish their experiences and share the ups and downs of what works and what doesn't and then create a forum in which we can all meet and create together.



It is known that schools must change - that we are not providing our students with the skills needed to succeed in tomorrow's world; however, neither parents, administrators, or policy makers want to take the risk. Maybe we need universities to make the move so that k-12 educators can justify to parents that transforming how and what students learn will mean they will be ready for college...just a thought."

362,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"I've been thinking a lot about what Will Richardson said back in June at this year's ISTE conference. During one of his sessions, he discussed some innovative trends in education and their implications on learning. Part way through this discussion he made this statement,""We don't need better teachers, we just need them to be different.""Is that the case? Do we just need our teachers to begin to unlearn, relearn and think differently about student learning?Or, do our teachers actually need to improve? Do they need to be&nbsp;better?&nbsp;What are you seeing in your districts? What implications would this have on our districts' approach to professional development?"
363,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,What I see is the need for time.&nbsp
364,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"I agree, the moment i had one teacher show the others how they used Evernote for assessment, many members of staff wanted to know how they could have it on their iPads. Sometimes teachers need to see things practically for them to realise the impact on teaching.&nbsp;"
365,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,Peer mentoring is a very effective learning tool. &nbsp
366,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"Tapping the expertise that exists within schools already among educators is a profitable way to expand the expertise of everyone in the school, generate clearer focus on the outcomes for students, and share the work. So often people think that the only source of expert information comes from outside the school. Roland Barth wrote: ""I wonder how many children's lives would be saved if we educators disclosed what we know to each other."""
367,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"I agree that providing a structure and opportunity for teachers to share is a powerful practice - in our building, we provided such a day and then identified the ""SMART Board leader"", ""Moodle leader"", ""Google Apps leader"", etc. &nbsp;Having peers work with others after school and during planning and collaboration periods is terrific. This is a step in the right direction.I also believe that having embedded tech coaches in buildings who are able to support teachers DURING their classes - while they are in the trench; in action. &nbsp;A teacher who is hesitant with technology is going to become very frustrated and defeated when the expected technology glitches occur and they feel there is no support. &nbsp;Having those staff leaders mentioned above are great, but they are more than likely teaching their own classes at the same time Mrs. Smith is having a meltdown in front of 25 sixth graders because her online content can't be accessed."
368,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"I am still hung up on: First things first!&nbsp;PD on school climate and culture change as priority. I did further some further reading. http://www.rucharacter.org/file/DevelopingandAssessingSchoolCulture_Final[1].pdf&nbsp; Weed the garden then plant replant the technology seeds. Every garden grows better without weeds.&nbsp; I tell those teachers who get hung up on glitches... ""These are the problems of their tomorrow! As we learn to work patiently through&nbsp;todays glitches&nbsp;we teach them to handle their future glitches patiently"" The teachers who have melt downs have limited trouble shooting experience. Time for the 21st Century Aide!&nbsp;"
369,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"Jay, we have our Tech Day coming up and hope to strengthen the peer to peer networking around technology. I put together one of these days a couple years ago when admin gave me a workshop day and teachers have been asking to do this every year. Peer to Peer networking and support is so important and these tech days give it the boost. Pretty excited!https://sites.google.com/a/msad54.org/tech-day/"
370,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"Teacher and administrator preparedness- peer mentoring is a great way for teachers to connect. As the Director of Curriculum, &nbsp;I plan to attend the iPad Summit in Boston with the 8th grade team ( we piloted 1-1 this fall) and I'm excited to go and support our teachers. What I find challenging is that I attend workshops but since I am not a ""teacher"" and have different responsibilities the application part is tough. But I feel as though I need to experience this our teachers and at least know the lingo. &nbsp; I was disappointed when we held our school wide digital learning day and some of the administrators taught workshops while others hung out in the cafe eating muffins and drinking coffee... really? What about being in this together? I think it is unfair to have new expectations for teachers while some administrators ""provide PD"" but are not actively engaged or involved. The role of administrator needs to change as much as that of a teachers.&nbsp;"
371,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"I agree with Joanne. &nbsp;Digital leadership needs to come from the top down and not just from the Director of Technology. &nbsp;Technology is not going away, so everyone needs to find their niche. &nbsp;It is impossible to know everything about using technology in the classroom. &nbsp;Whether it is iPad apps, Google Apps, Smartboards, find something you know well enough to be able to&nbsp;""provide PD"" when possible."
372,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"So many good ideas and thoughts here. &nbsp;Using inhouse mentors is definitely a wonderful way to go. &nbsp;Having after school workshops for no more than an hour is a great learning experience, and teachers know who to go and see afterwards if they need help with using the application afterwards. &nbsp;Something we have done here in the past and hope to do again is Summer Boot Camps where we spend a full day or two learning new technologies or applications. &nbsp;We hire an outside consultant who understands how these applications can be used in the classroom, which is very important.We are also fortunate to currently have a principal who is likely to be at all of our workshops herself learning what she is expecting us to know."
373,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"Great conversation and ideas! As many of you noted, PD can be combination of both outside experts and in-house staff, and can engage teachers and administrators together. None of this needs to be one or the other!And, all of this can be done either face-to-face or online, or in a blend of both! &nbsp;Online environments can be particularly useful for teachers and administrators to reflect together, and learn from each other in a way that meets the crazy schedules teachers and school leaders have!Barbara&nbsp;"
374,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"I definitely have great teachers at my school, but great at doing what they think are effective strategies based on their own limited experience and not based on research. Because I'm relatively new as the principal coming into a small private school that has never really been stretched professionally, some of the old guard are freaking out. I'm hoping that with effective PD, we can get them to where they need to be. My challenge is patience. I want them to hear it once and change NOW, yet I know that's not realistic."
375,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"What I have learned is that change is important to motivate change. Teachers will have difficulty changing if the teaching environment is the same....routine....what they know. As the principal, I have initiated a change (a varying size) each year. (to the timetable, to school routines, to location of classrooms, to the grade level teams). The critical factor is to have a change that in its scope is challenging but not hugely anxiety causing. Of course, ""we"" do not like change but if we do not experience it, it gives us the idea that ""stuck"" is OK.&nbsp;Change sheds new light on what we do, brings in fresh air, causes dialogue, assists in developing new responses and going through a process to implement and become efficient in the new ways.&nbsp;That is the mind set needed in the environment - we can leverage this to motivate.&nbsp;""Get them where they need to be"" implies pulling. Doesn't work as well as pushing - little or medium steps at a time.&nbsp;"
376,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"Great ideas. I agree that PD is extremely important like Peer mentoring. The problem that we have in Portugal is that the Ministery od Education doesn't support teachers and each year we need to work more hours doing things not related with teaching classes but related with burocracy and receive less money, and less positive feedback. For that reason many teachers are very disapointed with the education in Portugal.I always see the positive aspects and try to forget the real problems &nbsp;that are not related with teaching because is what matters for me.Education define the future in a country but seems that Portuguese government doesn't think the same.The portuguese teachers need to have continuous training to get forward with actual teaching and actual teaching metodology.I believe that with a good strategy schools can improve a lot the students learning and provide a great future to tehir students. A Digital Learning Transition is essential for this goal."
377,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"Peer mentoring has the greatest potential but it needs to be in the individual's classroom. &nbsp;A few years ago, I did a morning PD workshop for my coworkers as the ""Moodle-Leader"" in the school. &nbsp;Everyone said it looked great and wanted to use Moodle too. &nbsp;A few logged in and set up something but no one followed through. &nbsp;The students were asking them to use Moodle and I know each teacher wanted to use it. &nbsp;If I had had the opportunity to sit with each teacher and help them set up, more teachers would have used it. &nbsp;I did not have the time to spend hours with each teacher as much as I would have liked to help.When eMints was active in Maine, teachers felt greater support because there was always someone to go to for help. &nbsp;More programs for teachers supporting teachers across districts and schools would make a difference."
378,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"Going back to the original post about ""better or different"", in the case of my district ""different"" is definitely in order. Sure, we have a few teachers who need to get better, but for the most part we have strong, dedicated teachers. The problem is many of them don't realize that even great teachers are going to have to do things differently because the world is different. There are habits and skills that the 21st century requires of its citizens that are not going to be developed if we continue to teach the way we always have. As we look at aligning our curriculum with the Common Core and making a digital transition, we're trying to keep these 21st century skills and habits of mind in the forefront. Our students need to do things differently than we did as kids...so we need to teach them differently."
379,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"I agree with Tracy about the need for teachers (and administrators) to have time to learn, to plan, to share, and to collaborate with colleagues.&nbsp; There is much our colleagues do that we could learn from them, but there is so little time to collaborate and share. To truly implement this shift, we need to find ways to take that time; as our students, we need time to learn, to try new things, to fail, and to try again.&nbsp; Structured time during the school day would go a long way towards implementing this shift."
380,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"I feel that across the board there needs to be change. &nbsp;Instead of administration telling teachers (in a sit and get format) that they need to change their way of teaching, that the administrator needs to be the change they want to see. &nbsp;This is the only way that administrators can see how difficult it truly is to incorporate technology but also how effective it is!"
381,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"One important component of making the transition, is to provide educators with their own professional learning activities that make use of the tools and approaches that are central to the digital learning transition for students.&nbsp;Participation in MOOCs such as this one, or in other other online courses, social media experiences and other digital learning opportunities, enable educators to understand the pedagogical shifts digital learning enables.&nbsp;This has been central to the work we've been doing in EdTech Leaders Online, where educators experience digital learning ""hands-on"" in formal and informal online courses and activities, as they think and prepare for the digital learning transition in their classrooms, schools, districts and beyond.Barbara Treacy"
382,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"I am a Tech teacher in an elementary school with above average tech knowledge and I am not sure I know enough about how to create these digital learning opportunities and then guide teachers to create them for their students. I know about learning websites, but is this the best way for students to learn, through games? &nbsp;Should teachers be creating videos for their students to watch? Online tests? &nbsp;I am knot sure I am wrapping my head around how this all works.&nbsp;"
383,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"What I'd like to see happen is my tech leader having the time to look at my core and find things I can incorporate safely and adequately in my class.&nbsp; This takes time but once you find appropriate videos, games, and &nbsp;resources, they are very easy to share with others.&nbsp;Perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp;we need each state to take a group of expert teachers and create&nbsp;common core options and lessons like we did&nbsp;10-12 years ago when technology was just in it's infancy.&nbsp; I remember having the option to take classes and create units that were shared across the state.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the online lessons are now tied in with the old CSO's and not common core.&nbsp; We need time to create the lessons/units and share with others."
384,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"I think there needs to be a person in each school ( grade level, subject) whose job is to identify appropriate digital resources and then train teachers in their use. Doing this at a state wide level&nbsp;wouldn't have the flexibility needed to reflect unique teaching situations.&nbsp;A librarian with a computer is the perfect resource person for this job. The librarian's function, afterall, is to disseminate information to the right people."
385,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"I am a Technology Integrationist, just assumed that position and when i share tools with teachers i have often been asked the question, ""Where do you get all these apps?"" the month of October was the 'Connected Educator Month. I think it is important for teachers to establish a Personal Learning Network that enables them to see what others are doing and ask questions and be able to get help when they need it. The network does not have to be big, It can be as simple as following a blog like&nbsp;http://www.freetech4teachers.com/&nbsp;and following a twitter hash tag once in a while. If an administrator is not yet an adopter, they are not going to see professional development in that area as important. They will therefore not provide the necessary support and encouragement for teachers. this is where having your own network can help.&nbsp;"
386,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,But how do we go from a app here and there to a blended classroom and then a flipped classroom? &nbsp
387,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"Our committee taking this course has talked about having an integration specialist in each school (maybe a librarian or other tech savvy individual) who will get release time to work with teachers in their classrooms going over unit plans and making suggestions for technology integration.&nbsp; Here the training begins.&nbsp; We've also talked about meeting by departments once a month - each month our integration specialist would teach a few content specific (or universal) apps working with them to learn the apps, and implementation, then each Friday, during their PLC time,&nbsp;teachers can see how each other is doing and trouble shoot, etc...&nbsp; I really do agree that involving our teachers in a ready made online course such as Mooc-Ed would be pivotal in exposing educators to the pedagogical shifts of digital learning and I LOVE the idea of modeling their training / activities by actually using the tools as their students would.&nbsp; For many on our staff - this could be overwhelming so starting with baby steps for the technically challenged is important to keep in mind."

Beth, the key is not to start with the tool or the tech. Start with the learning you want to take place. What do you want kids to know, understand, and be able to do. In many cases, there will be a technology way to make it happen better, faster, more efficiently. The key to being a good tech teacher and tech coach for teachers is to slowly build your own repertoire of tools and tech strategies that you know can help students learn.You mentioned teachers making videos. The question isn't, ""Should teachers make videos?"" but rather, ""Is there something that a teacher-made video can do to help learning?"" The answer depends on what learning needs to happen. There is no technology that will magically make you or anyone else a better teacher. It just gives you more ways to engage and teach learners."
389,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"I also agree with Gerald. I work with teachers on designing units using UBD (Understanding by Design) and have them work backwards to set their targets - what students should know, understand and be able to do. Once they have that in place, we look at assessments, formal and informal that will enable teachers to gather data on student learning and help students track where they are in the learning process. When we hit the assessment design, this is where we look to technology to help teach smarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, one teacher uses Padlet to create vocabulary walls, another uses Google Docs to have students write essays or fill in organizers, another uses Todaysmeet or polleverywhere to check for understanding during a lecture or video, and another uses Socrative for a quick reading comprehension quiz. Others uses the iPad apps for peer review where they film each other practicing for an oral presentation. My teachers also use these digital tools as exit slips. Other language teachers have students record into their phones, then switch phones with a peer and the peer needs to translate in a Google Doc organizer, then provide feedback, and then the student re-records and sends that copy to the teacher. English teachers use Turnitin.com to check for plagiarism and also for grammar check before peer review (the kids really like the feature). Then kids submit essays and the teacher uses an App that allows him/her to provide oral feedback to the student.&nbsp;&nbsp;I went into my son's 3rd grade class last week and read a story to the kids. I used this is a modeling moment for how to make digital tools an organic part of learning. Before reading the story, I used polleverywhere to get the kids to predict what would happen to the bunny. The kids went wild when they saw the results and we began a discussion and why they responded the way they did. Then I read and the kids listened so intently b/c they wanted to find out if their prediction would come to fruition. At the end, we had another great discussion and I asked them another polleverywhere question - if they would recommend the book to a friend. That question helped me to gage their interest level and if it was worth reading to other classes.&nbsp;

These are just some examples of how our teachers are making digital learning a natural part of the learning process, rather than a separate, isolated entity."
390,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"Gerald and Robyn are

correct. As a classroom teacher we always ask ourselves what we need the

students to learn and what standard are they meeting? The next question would

be what type of learners do we have in class and what type of assessment is

needed to collect the correct data on each student? This brings me to the

belief that if you do not know curriculum it will be hard to understand what

tools will work to bring the greatest meaning to the class.



&nbsp;I have found one

road block that teachers run into, and that is having too many different

avenues for the students to hand in assignments. It becomes cumbersome and hard

to give immediate feedback. One way to overcome this situation is by finding a

tool you are most comfortable with and you can access 24/7."
391,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"Decades ago, Judith Warren Little conducted research about the impact of communities of learners committed to learning together. In her research she distinguished three types of work that teachers do. Independent work is the kind so many teachers do to get through their planning, grading, etc. Shared work occurs when teachers share information, ideas, resources, and products/processes with each other that they have each developed independently. The final, and most significant form of work as noted in her research, is joint work, the kind of work teachers do together when they are planning together, developing instructional resources, performance tasks, procedures, etc. as a team of co-developers. In this last form of work, teachers learn while they are working, share their collective wisdom and strengths, and refine their expertise together.Integrating technology into instruction requires inquiry, collaboration, discovery, invention, and the other processes we want students to experience. Teachers too can benefit when they experience this form of professional learning.&nbsp;"
392,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"I agree with so many comments above. &nbsp;Very insightful. &nbsp;We definitely need to look at our curriculum first and then&nbsp;decide how technology can be used to help us meet those goals. &nbsp;Too often I find teachers just finding a ""cool new tool"" and then slapping it into the lesson plans without really thinking things through. &nbsp;How many PowerPoint presentations have we all seen where the students come in to ""do research"" and just copy and paste information from a website into a slide or two and call it ""good enough"". &nbsp;What have the students truly learned from allowing this?Hiring a technology integrator who truly knows curriculum is paramount to finding success with our goal of incorporating technology into our lesson plans. &nbsp;Carrie was so right when she said,&nbsp;&nbsp;""if you do not know curriculum it will be hard to understand what tools will work to bring the greatest meaning to the class."""

394,Teacher and Administrator Preparedness,"I also agree with many of the above statements. Like with teaching k-12 students, it is important with teaching technology tools ans resources to educators that we make it relate: relate to the content and the grade level. Having a designated person at each school that is responsible for locating and assisting in the integration of these tools could be really helpful. As we were able to see in our videos this week, there are many teachers that are excited and willing to make the move to digital learning. They just need the right help.&nbsp;"

So very true, Ann. &nbsp;The ""dark side"" of technology is that it can be entertainment, rather than educational. &nbsp;Students can be very adept at mindless ""cutting and pasting""ﾅwithout passing through the necessary step of ""thinking"" and ""learning""ﾅ. &nbsp;It is still essential for the teacher to help ignite the flame of ""life-long learning."" Unfortunately, if the teacher is not a life-long leaner, it is virtually impossible to convey that passion. &nbsp;I was disappointed in the fourth article of our professional development readings this unit, which quoted the executive director of the eMINTS program in Missouri: &nbsp;""We want to help teachers learn to be learners again."" &nbsp;The presumption here is that (most?) teachers are NOT life-long learners -- that somewhere along the line they lost the spark -- the interest and the ability -- to learn. &nbsp;If this is true, then the goal of educational reform and excellence in the United States is hugely difficultﾅand may take a whole generation to accomplish.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"

@Peggy. &nbsp;The student presentation conveys many important messages so well. &nbsp;I'll suggest it to others. &nbsp;Their main message is captured by their request to ""teach us, guide us, trust us"" &nbsp;and their statements like: ""Our learning is not divided by subject area or by place and time;"" Things are shifting: students are no longer the only ones learning and teachers are no longer the only ones teaching;"" and ""We are ready to move our education to the next level."" &nbsp;A great example of students' views and how much we need to do to keep up with them"
